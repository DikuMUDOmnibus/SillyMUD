This directory contains the security listings.   Each 58+ level god must
have a file in this directory with their name, listing the allowed hosts
from which that character is able to connect. This file can have multiple
lines, and if any of them match the current connection address, the
player will be allowed in. Entries can be plain IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, as:

1.2.3.4
1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888

or IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR blocks (to add a block of addresses), as:

1.2.3.4/16
1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888/64

or hostnames, as:

doldrums.cis.ufl.edu
